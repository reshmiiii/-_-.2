          <p>
            <b>Roger Federer</b>,(born August 8,1981,Basel,Switzerland),is a Swiss tennis player who dominated the sport in the early 21st century with his exceptional all-around game. He won a record eight Wimbledon titles,and in 2018 he became the first player to claim 20 Grand Slam men’s singles titles. Federer,who started playing tennis at age eight,became Switzerland’s junior champion when he was 14. In 1998 he captured the Wimbledon junior singles championship and secured the Orange Bowl junior tournament crown in Miami. The following year Federer made his debut on the Swiss Davis Cup team and became the youngest tennis player (at 18 years 4 months) to end the year among the world’s top 100,finishing that season at number 64. Federer competed at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney,advancing to the bronze medal match. The following year at Wimbledon he defeated Pete Sampras to reach the quarterfinals,and by the end of 2002 he was ranked number six in the world. In 2003 Federer won his first Grand Slam tournament title,at Wimbledon. The following year he captured his first Australian Open and his first U.S. Open and defended his Wimbledon title. A gifted shot maker known for his forehand,he also developed a reputation for composure and sportsmanship. In 2004 Federer was victorious in 11 of the 17 tournaments he played in,and he finished the year ranked number one in the world. His numbers were similarly remarkable in 2005,as he won 11 of 15 tournaments,including Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. From July 2003 to November 2005 he also won a modern-record 24 straight finals. Throughout his career,Federer enjoyed huge success at Wimbledon,reaching the final almost every year. He holds the all-time record for the most Wimbledon men's singles tennis titles,winning it eight times between 2003 and 2017,including five in a row from 2003-07. On 15 September 2022,he announced his impending retirement from professional tennis on the ATP Tour,noting that the Laver Cup would be his final ATP event.
